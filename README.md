My first shot at using XNA. It works, but it's ugly as sin, and will suffer several refactorings as I learn XNA and C# idioms.

How to use
----------

Get Visual Studio (I used [Visual C# 2010 Express][vcsx10], it's free) and [XNA Game Studio 4.0][xna4], add the solution, and build it. A binary will be created somewhere inside the project. Dunno if there's a better way to do things in the .NET world.

To do
-----

* **Testing**. Kinda silly for a small project like this, but it's a good excuse to learn how .NET folks do stuff around here.
* **Refactoring**. Basically prettying up the code. Already got some ideas for event processing, maybe break it away in a separate library.

Documentation
-------------

What do you mean documentation, my code isn't good enough for you? :P
